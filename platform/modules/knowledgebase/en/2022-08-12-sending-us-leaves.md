- This is a test to check to see that the pipeline is updating the site.
-
Leaves are the most common sample for plants.

- **From within Australia**, we can accept 20-25mg of fresh leaves - or 10-15mg if they are lyophilised (freeze dried in a vacuum) or oven dried
- **From outside Australia,** we can only accept tissue - 10-15mg - that has been lyophilised or oven dried. It must also be pulverised so it can pass Australia’s strict quarantine laws. See the Australian Border Force website for more information: abf.gov.au.

If you can, we recommend you collect leaves into liquid nitrogen, but if not collect them onto ice blocks or, if that’s also not possible, a desiccant like silica beads or gel.

**_NOTE: Do not send leaf material at room temperature that has previously been frozen. The gDNA will be degraded before it can reach us._**

### Hardware

The quality of your samples and our ability to process them efficiently with our automated plate processing equipment are greatly improved when the samples are prepared into the right plasticware.

For plant tissue, we recommend you use either:

- ‘MicroTube Rack System™, 1.1mL Single Tubes in Racks’ (National Scientific Supply Company catalogue numbers TN0946-01R for racks and TN0946-01B) or an equivalent product
- Sealed with the ‘Pierceable TPE Micronic capband-8 cluster ’ (capmat format) - Micronic catalogue number MP53024) or equivalent.

Or:

- 1.1mL Microtube System, Racked (Thermo-Fisher catalogue number 15082, or
- 1.40mL non-coded push cap tubes, U-bottom in Micronic 96-4 rack with low cover (barcoded A1-H1 side) (Micronic catalogue number MP32136)
- Sealed with Thermo-Fisher 1.2mL Microtiter tub 8-cap plug strip (catalogue number QSP847), or
- Micronic TPE Capband-8 (catalogue number MP53018)

These may be available from:

- The National Scientific Supply Co, Inc., http://nat-sci.com/product/mtrs-racks-and-tubes/ for tubes1.
- Micronic, https://www.micronic.com/product/tpe-push-caps
- Thermo-Fisher Scientific, https://www.thermofisher.com
- Or if you have any difficulty, please let us know and we can send you - via DHL Courier - what you need. This will be charged to you at cost price, added to your final invoice. Check the DHL website https://www.dhl.com/ to check pricing

### Preparing the samples

Provide around 10mg of plant tissue per tube. That’s about 2-3 leaf discs of 3-5mm diameter per tube

![sample](/assets/img/sample.png)

**This is a useful method for cutting leaf tissue into equal sample sizes for each tube.**

![sample-2](\assets\img\sample-2.png)

**Cutting leaves into 3mm pieces is also possible, be careful to make sure the samples sizes are uniform.**

![sample 3](\assets\img\sample-3.png)

**Cutting is the only method possible for acicular (needle-like) or linear leaves. Again, make sure the sample sizes are uniform. In this illustration, samples B1 to H1 would not be able to be effectively crushed for DNA extraction. If we need to sub-sample manually, this can affect the cost and time it takes to process your order.**

_Label the tubes with their well position within the plate. Leave tubes G12 and H12 empty, because we need to use them for our control._

Firmly and securely seal all the tubes across the rack.
