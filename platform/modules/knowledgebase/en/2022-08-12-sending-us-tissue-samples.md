We recommend (?prefer?) that you extract the gDNA from sensitive or valuable materials such as museum or herbarium collections, or materials from prolonged storage

If you do have to rely on our DNA extraction services, we will do our best, however it is critical you alert us that your material is sensitive or valuable, by adding a clear and detailed note to your order and [Sample Tracking File](/documenting-your-sample). There’s a ‘Comments’ field where you can do that.

With this knowledge, we may vary our extraction method, as standard procedures may not be sufficient for such samples.

### If you’re unsure about the required size or nature of these samples, please contact DArT for guidance.
