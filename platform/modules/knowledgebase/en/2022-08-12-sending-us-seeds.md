The ideal seed sample size is 20-25mg.

- **From within Australia**, seeds don’t require any special treatment, although they should be packed with silica beads or gel
- **From outside Australia**, seeds must be pulverised to the consistency of fine flour so the sample can pass Australia’s strict quarantine laws. See the Australian Border Force website for more information: abf.gov.au.

### Hardware

The quality of your seed samples and our ability to process them efficiently with our automated plate processing equipment are greatly improved when the samples are prepared into the right plasticware.

For seeds, we recommend you use:

- The National Scientific Supply Co, Inc., [http://nat-sci.com/product/mtrs-racks-and-tubes/](http://nat-sci.com/product/mtrs-racks-and-tubes/) for tubes1
- Micronic, [https://www.micronic.com/product/tpe-push-caps](https://www.micronic.com/product/tpe-push-caps)
- Or if you have any difficulty, please let us know and we can send you what you need.

### Preparing the samples

Provide a small number of seeds - or the equivalent quantity of pulverised seeds if sending from outside Australia - in each plate well.

- For mid-size grains like barley, rice, wheat, sorghum and oats, add about five (5) seeds to each tube
- For small-sized seeds like brassica and poppy, put in about twenty (20) to thirty (30) per tube.

**When sending from outside Australia, add about 20-30mg of pulverised seed to each tube**

- _Label the tubes with their well position within the plate. Leave tubes G12 and H12 empty, because we need to use them for our control._

- Firmly and securely seal all the tubes across the rack.

- For samples being sent from Australia, if correct plasticware is not available, make sure that seeds are securely packaged to avoid leaking from the packaging or allowing contaminants to enter

- Make sure all bags and envelopes are resistant to tearing, and plastics like Ziploc bags are securely sealed.

`Contact us if you have any questions about the preparation of your samples.`
