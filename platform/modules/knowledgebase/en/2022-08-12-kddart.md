## Knowledge Discovery and Delivery System

The KDDart Knowledge Discovery System provides users with the ability to securely and efficiently integrate three diverse types of data:

Phenotypic;
Genetic;
Environmental.
Typically this system would be used for breeding and pre-breeding applications. However, KDDart's flexible architecture can be applied to a variety of multidisciplinary, agro-ecological and environmental research undertakings.

Offering KDDart as an Open Source platform is intended to pave the way for a collaborative environment to develop software applications that address current and future research needs.
