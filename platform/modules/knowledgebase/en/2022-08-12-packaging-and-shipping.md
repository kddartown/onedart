If you’re unsure about the required size or nature of these samples, please contact DArT for guidance.

- Make sure labelled **_deep well plates_** are properly sealed. Use the correct seal for each plate, or place cardboard over the plate and attach it securely with rubber bands **_(photo)_**
- with rubber bands (photo) - Place the lid on top of labelled **_racked tubes_** with a tissue between teh seals and the lid. Push down the seals and secure the lid in place with a rubber band
- Firmly seal all bags - preferably using double layer ziplock plastic bags or Parafilm
- Package in a rigid box or container with ample padding - bubble wrap or styrofoam - to allow for rough handling during shipment.
