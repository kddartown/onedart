Glossary
==================



The following terms are used within the KDDart platform:

.. glossary::

  Accept/Suppress Values
     Either accepting values as being valid, or suppressing values that the user deems as invalid. This is useful when multiple users have collected data on the same trait and have differing values.

  Attachments
     Photos/video captured from the devices camera, audio from the microphone or file(s) uploaded and attached.

  Auto-Advance Scoring
     A KDSmart feature which allows the user to concentrate on only those Traits for which a measurement has not been provided. It automatically advances to the next un-scored trait to be scored which allows for quicker and more efficient scoring.

  Bundles
     A mechanism for grouping traits and tags to assist with their management e.g. a bundle of tags for varying degrees of bird damage: BD, BD+, BD++, etc.

  Collection Order
     The way of progressing or walking through a trial or area in which data is to be collected.

  CSV
     Comma Separated Values - A widely used, simple text format for transferring data usually created in a spreadsheet and saved in the CSV format. The first row of the file provides the column names and each row following is a data record.

  Curation
     The management of data including accepting, changing, or deleting values that are collected i.e. changing a value for a trait that was entered incorrectly.

  Data Exchange
     Exchanging data between KDXplore and KDSmart. A connection can be established with KDXchange.

  Days Since Planting
     Ability to enter a date (i.e. by selecting 'Today') which is automatically converted to the number of days since planting, e.g. for recording anthesis.

  KDDart
     Refers to the KDDart Knowledge Discovery System which features centralised database storage for storing phenotypic trial data.

  KDXchange
     The server software within KDXplore and KDSmart which enables them to communicate, for example to copy trials, traits or tags between the devices. This is not a separate application.

  Phenotypic
     Observable characteristics of an individual specimen i.e. The collection of phenotypic data involves recording observable characteristics such as plant height.

  Plots and Sub-Plots
     Trials contain multiple plots - areas, spaces or even pots, uniquely identified by a plot ID or by coordinate (Column/row ID) pairs, or both. Sub-plots are individual specimens within a plot.

  Samples
     A trait measurement of a plot or sub-plot.

  Scoring Set
     A scoring set is a set of trait instances and samples that can be sent from KDXplore to a KDSmart device for scoring. When the data is scored and returned to KDXplore, it appears in the scoring set as a progress meter. Scoring sets can be named and only the trait instances needed to score have to be added (only those trait instances specified for the set in KDXplore are sent to KDSmart).

  Specimen
     The single *unit* or *entity* under investigation and refers to a *sub-plot* or an *individual*. Multiple specimens can be scored within a plot and not all specimens need to be scored.

  Tags
     Shorthand labels to enable quick annotation of a specimen from a pre-set selection list. These are distinct from *notes* as they are used in different situations, but are similar in purpose. 

  Traits
     The phenotypic characteristic being monitored or scored for each plot or specimen (e.g. height, colour, etc.).

  Trait Instance
     A single occurrence of a trait being used. Multiple trait instances can be used in a trial so that one trait can be used more than once.

  Trait Order
     The order that traits are scored within KDSmart. This order can be changed in KDXplore and KDSmart.

  Trial or Nursery
     This refers to a study, experiment, nursery, project, etc. Multiple trials may be loaded into KDSmart.
