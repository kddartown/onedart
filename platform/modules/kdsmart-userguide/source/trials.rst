Trials

KDSmart is designed for collecting data for *trials*. Trials can either be `imported <https://www.kddart.org/help/kdsmart/html/data-import-export-backup.html>`_ from external sources, `transferred <https://www.kddart.org/help/kdsmart/html/exchangedata.html>`_ from KDXplore, or `created <https://www.kddart.org/help/kdsmart/html/trials.html#creating-a-trial>`_ within KDSmart.

Trials in KDSmart can be viewed and managed from the **Trials screen**:

This page provides more information on trials, including creating and managing them in KDSmart.

What is a Trial?
================

*Trial*  is the general term used in KDDart to refer to studies, experiments, nurseries, projects, etc. Trials contain data on the physical layout of a field and trial details and the plots and sub-plots within that field.

Trials also contain `traits <https://www.kddart.org/help/kdsmart/html/traits.html>`_ which are the qualities or characteristics being scored, and possibly `tags <https://www.kddart.org/help/kdsmart/html/tags.html>`_ that are reusable notes.

Generally, a trial is created in KDXplore or KDManage, transferred to KDSmart for scoring in the field, transferred back to KDXplore for data curation, and finally uploaded into KDDart.

|br|

.. tip:: Trials contain multiple *plots* - areas, spaces or even pots, uniquely identified by a plot ID, coordinate pairs (column/row ID), or both. *Subplots* are individual specimens within a plot.


|br|

Trial Types
-----------

There are three types of trials in KDXplore:

* Column and Row (X/Y) - the combination of column and row numbers is a unique identifier for every plot in the trial;
* Plot ID - the plot ID is a unique identifier for every plot; and
* Block - the combination of block, column, and row numbers is a unique identifier for each plot.


|br|

Trial Details
----------------

Each trial contains a set of attributes that define its characteristics. You can find the details for each trial in the **Trial Details screen**:

Trial Management
=================

Trials in KDSmart are managed from the **Trials screen**, shown in the sections above. This screen has options for many trial management activities such as importing, exporting, creating, and editing trials.

New X/Y and Plot ID trials can be created within KDSmart.

.. note:: Currently, you cannot create new block trials in KDSmart. Instead, you will need to import or transfer them into the app.

Adding & Removing Traits in a Trial
-----------------------------------

Trials need to have traits added to them for scoring. You can also remove traits from an existing trial.

.. list-table:: Adding Traits to a Trial
   :widths: 1 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Step
     - Action
   * - **1.**
     - Select the **Trial Details button** to view the details of a trial.
   * - **2.**
     - Select the **Edit Traits button** to display the **Trait Instances screen**. If there are existing traits, it will list them here. See the `Preparing for Scoring <https://www.kddart.org/help/kdsmart/html/preparation.html#trait-instance>`_ page for information on this screen.
   * - **3.**
     - Select the **Menu button**, and choose traits to add from under the title *Trait Bundles*. They are organised in bundles (if you have any bundles). This allows you to add sets of related traits at once.
   * - **4.**
     - Select the **Confirm button** to add the traits. You will now see the newly added traits in the **Trait Instances screen**.

To remove traits, go to the **Trait Instances screen** and select the **Manage Traits button** to open a menu where you will find the *Remove option*.

.. note:: If you donâ€™t want to score a trait, it is not always necessary to completely remove it from the trial. See the `Preparing for Scoring <https://www.kddart.org/help/kdsmart/html/preparation.html#trait-instance>`_ page for information on how to deselect traits when scoring.

|br|

Editing Trial Details
---------------------

Trial details are displayed in the **Trial Details screen**. You can edit some *details*; however, trial *attributes* that are imported data are not editable. Each editable detail will have an **Edit button** next to it.
