Introduction
============

There are several methods of moving data in to and out of KDSmart which can be found on the  *Data - Import, Export, Backup* page at: http://www.kddart.org/help/kdsmart/html/data-import-export-backup.html#data-import-export-backup  

This topic focuses on using KDXplore with KDSmart, which provides more time saving and productivity benefits for the user. Previously, inbuilt software called KDXchange was used to transfer data between KDXplore and KDSmart. Both applications have recently been updated to include integration with Google Drive which requires much less effort in setup. Whilst an internet connection is required, both devices do not need to be on the same Wi-Fi network. Google Drive is now the recommended method, however, there may still be a need to use KDXchange so both methods are outlined here. |br|
The following sections outline the steps required for exchanging data between KDSmart and KDXplore:

- Setup - Connecting KDXplore to KDSmart Devices; and
- Transfer - Moving data (Trials, Traits and Tags) between KDSmart and KDXplore.

For more information on why you would need to transfer data, see the *KDSmart Home Page* at http://www.kddart.org/help/kdsmart/html/index.html 
See the *KDXplore Home Page* at http://www.kddart.org/help/kdxplore/html/index.html to learn about how you can use KDXplore for data management and curation.

Data Transfer - Google Drive Method 
------------------------------------

Google Drive is a quick and easy way of exchanging data between devices and requires little setup time. The example provided will take you from exporting a Scoring Set from KDXplore to Google Drive, importing it into KDSmart, exporting the Scored Data file to Google Drive, and then importing that file into KDXplore for curation.

The process of exchanging data will be described in the following steps:

  1. Connect to the Internet
  2. Google Drive Setup
  3. Transferring Files from KDXplore to Google Drive
  4. Transferring Files into KDSmart from Google Drive
  5. Transferring Files from KDSmart to Google Drive
  6. Transferring Files into KDXplore from Google Drive

|br|

Step 1 - Connect to the Internet 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Google Drive transfers will only work when devices are connected to the internet but they do not have to be connected at the same time. For example, a user on KDXplore may export a Scoring Set to Google Drive which is uploaded to their personal folder, turn off their computer, and then go out into the field and import that Scoring Set into to KDSmart. For users who do not have mobile data on their KDSmart device or are in an area that does not have signal, it will still be necessary to connect to WiFi.

For further information on setting up WiFi please see the :ref:`Using WiFi` section below.   

|br|

Step 2 - Google Drive Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As well as having an internet connection, you will need to have a Google account which gives you access to Google Drive. A free account will provide 15gb of space which is more than enough for using with KDXplore and KDSmart. To sign up or access *Google Drive* see the following page: https://www.google.com/drive/.

This link will be usable on KDXplore, Android devices should have a Google Drive application that would usually be already installed by default but can also be found in the Google Play Store. 

|br|

Step 3 - Transferring Files from KDXplore to Google Drive 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Once a Trial, Trait or Tag has been created, it needs to be transferred to a KDSmart device for use in the field. The following instructions demonstrate how to transfer Trials (or other data) from KDXplore to Google Drive so that they can be used in KDSmart.

  * - **1.** 
    - Ensure that Google Drive is opened in an internet browser and have KDXplore open to prepare for the transfer.
  * - **2.**
    - Choose a Scoring Set such as the one at |circle1| and then select the **Export** button at |circle2|.  
  * - **3.**
    - The **Export** window displays (as at |circle3|) which provides export options. Select the *Browse* button to choose a location on the computer to save the Scoring Set to. Ensure that the radio button for *KDX* file is selected so that it is ready to be used in KDSmart. 
  * - **4.**
    - Select either the *Export* or the *Export & Close* options within the **Export** window and the KDX file will be exported to your chosen location. A dialogue opens and asks whether you want to open the containing directory - do this if you want to transfer the file to Google Drive immediately.
  * - **5.**
    - *Click+drag* the file into the web browser with Google Drive opened and drop it to complete the upload. The file should now appear in Google Drive and there is a message which confirms that the upload has been completed.

Data Transfer - KDXchange Method 
--------------------------------

Whilst the Google Drive method is now the recommended method for exchanging data between KDXplore and KDSmart, KDXchange is still provided as a backup method for exchanging data.   

|br|

Setup - Connecting KDXplore to KDSmart Devices
-----------------------------------------------

Connecting Devices has three steps.

|br|


.. _Using WiFi:

Step 1 - Using WiFi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

KDXplore and KDSmart devices connect and synchronise data using a WiFi network.

The KDSmart device(s) and the KDXplore laptop/PC **must** be connected and visible to each other on the **same network** (i.e. same wifi connection). This is a networking requirement and not a limitation of KDSmart/KDXchange.

.. Note:: Depending on the network configuration, there may be times when your PC/Laptop is connected to a wired network (not on WiFi) yet will be able to connect to KDSmart devices on WiFi.

.. Tip:: Many organisational IT policies lock computer settings preventing the setup or activation of your own WiFi Hotspot without needing Administrator user access on the computer. |br| **Before** travelling to ‘the field’ we suggest you prepare, test and become familiarised with this means of connecting devices. Seek support in your organisation if needed.

             KDSmart - WiFi Connection Warning Example



If the message above is displayed try the **Connect Anyway** button, however, this may result in mixed success. Only a couple of tries is needed!

|br|

In the Field - Your Own WiFi Hotspot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a WiFi network is unavailable at your location, a portable WiFi hotspot can be created on your Laptop (if it has that capability). The connection can then be shared with your other KDSmart devices using KDXchange (see the above tip).


|br|

The KDXchange Window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The KDXchange window can be found by opening KDXplore on a PC and then opening the **Trial Manager** module by selecting the |trial_manager_btn| icon. Once the module is open, select the **KDXchange Server** |picture3| icon.


The following image displays a section of the KDXchange screen highlighted to show the following areas:

- |circle1| **Connection** panel is where the options to connect devices are located. This includes the IP Address where the KDXchange server will be created. 
- |circle2| **KDXplore** panel links KDXplore from the user's computer. This means that the list of Trials, Traits, and Tags that are on the user's version of KDXplore are displayed. The user will need to choose between either the Trials, Traits or Tags to be selected. 
- |circle3| **KDSmart Devices** is a list of all the KDSmart devices that are connected to KDXchange or are available for connection. The image demonstrates that a device named 'Galaxy S8+' from the user named 'Tester' is currently connected. 
- |circle4| **Device** is a panel which displays data from the currently connected KDSmart device.

.. Note:: KDXchange server software in KDXplore and KDSmart enables them to communicate and needs to be kept running on the pc/laptop until any synchronisation tasks between the devices has completed. Also, the devices should be kept in close proximity whilst connected. Once tasks have completed the KDXchange server can be stopped.

Step 2 - Prepare KDXplore/KDXchange
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transfer - Moving data (Trials, Traits and Tags) between KDSmart and KDXplore
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transferring KDSmart data to/from KDXplore requires KDXplore and the
KDSmart device(s) to be connected and waiting to transfer files.

The steps in the previous section, `Setup - Connecting KDXplore to KDSmart Devices`_ **must**
be performed first before proceeding here.


.. admonition:: Battery - Power Saving
                
                When a WiFi connection between KDSmart device(s) and KDXplore is established the power saving options on the device(s) may be overridden and the devices could remain **on**. |BR| If needing to conserve battery power on the phone/tablet/laptop, it may be advisable to stop the connection once data transfers have been completed.
