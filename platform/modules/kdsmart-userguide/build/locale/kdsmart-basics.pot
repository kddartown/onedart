msgid "KDSmart is an application used to collect phenotypic data from plants that are a part of trials. It allows you to add information about a plot or sub-plot that you have observed (e.g. plant height) and then saves that information in the trial. You can then export the data to save it in the KDDart database."

msgid "Trials are generally created in KDManage or KDXplore and then loaded onto a device with KDSmart, such as a mobile phone. Once the KDSmart device has a trial to work with, the user can go into the field and collect information on traits of the plot and sub-plots (this is known as *scoring*)."

#: ../../source/kdsmart-basics.rst:140
msgid "Tags can be applied to each plot or sub-plot to define characteristics that are not measured by traits. The data collected with KDSmart can then be loaded into KDXplore for curation and storage. A guide for this basic workflow is outlined in the `KDTutorials <http://www.kddart.org/help/kdtutorials/html/index.html>`_ section."
