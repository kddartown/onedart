#: ../../source/kdsmart-basics.rst:109
msgid "KDSmart is an application that is used to collect phenotypic data from plants that are a part of trials. It allows the user to add information about a plot or sub-plot that they have observed (e.g. plant height), and then save that information in the trial. Data can then be exported and saved in the KDDart database."

msgid "**Trait** - The quality or characteristic being inspected, measured and recorded for the organism e.g. plant height. There are traits for both plots and sub-plots and can be used in multiple trials."

msgid "**Tag** - Short text codes that provide a quick method of applying predefined classification or annotation to Plots or sub-plots e.g. BD is a tag that can refer to bird damage."

#: ../../source/kdsmart-basics.rst:138
msgid "Trials are generally created in KDManage or KDXplore and then loaded onto a device with KDSmart such as a mobile phone. Once the KDSmart device has a trial to work with, the user can go into the field and collect information on traits of the plot and sub-plots (this is known as *scoring*). Tags can be applied to each plot or sub-plot to define any characteristics that are not measured by traits. The data collected with KDSmart can then be loaded into KDXplore for curation and storage. A guide for this basic workflow is outlined in the `KDTutorials <http://www.kddart.org/help/kdtutorials/html/index.html>`_ section."
