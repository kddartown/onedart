Both applications have recently been updated to include integration with Google Drive which requires much less effort in setup. Whilst an internet connection is required, both devices do not need to be on the same Wi-Fi network. Google Drive is now the recommended method, however, there may still be a need to use KDXchange so both methods are outlined here. |br| The following sections outline the steps required for exchanging data between KDSmart and KDXplore:"
