00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,700
Traits are the characteristics or qualities that are measured or recorded in a trial.

2
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:14,299
Traits can be imported or created within the KDSmart app.

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,300
Go to the Traits screen and select the Add Trait button to create a new trait.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Firstly, enter a trait name and select the Use button to see if it's available. In this example, we will create a trait for measuring plant height.

5
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:40,733
Next, enter an alias and description for the trait.

6
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,900
You also need to add a trait unit. A trait unit is the unit of measurement for the trait. For example, metres.

7
00:01:03,966 --> 00:01:07,966
You must also choose a data type. Data types constrain the value of traits. In this example we will choose decimal.

8
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500
You can can configure constraints for some data types.

9
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,600
For this example, we will set the max to 2. 

10
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,100
This means that when entering a value for this trait, the user will need to choose a decimal number between 0 and 2.

11
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:32,666
Lastly, we need to choose a trait level. We will choose subplot-level four our example trait as we are measuring the height of an individual plant.

12
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:41,233
Select the Confirm button to save the new trait.

13
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:48,733
The new trait will be visible on the Traits screen.

14
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,700
This is what the trait would look like when scoring.

15
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:59,266
You can look though the data types to see what other traits you can create. 

16
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:04,666
Text traits enable users to input text into a text field.

17
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,700
Categorical traits provide a list of values to choose from.

18
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,933
Optionally you can add an 'other' field which lets users add a text note if a suitable option isn't available.

19
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:32,066
Elapsed days is the number of days since a specified date e.g. a planting date. The value is stored as a date by KDSmart.

20
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:37,733
An integer trait is a numeric value that must be a whole number. Like the decimal trait, it can include a range.

21
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:43,566
And finally a date trait is simply a date chosen with a calendar.

22
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:47,866
See the KDSmart User Guides for more infomation on traits.
